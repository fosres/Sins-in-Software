So I just wasted $7 on C: The Complete Reference

Sad.

What did I do wrong?

First: You tried to make a critical decision

when you were tired and exhausted: AT NIGHTTIME.

SECOND: You did not seriously do a pessimistic test

of what you were buying.

These stupid decisions MATTER. Because if you act like

that in the stock market, you will get your butt 

screened.

So never make a critical decision when you are exhausted

or tired. And don't bother doing anything until you perform

an extremely pessimistic test on the thing.
