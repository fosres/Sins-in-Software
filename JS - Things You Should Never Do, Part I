When this article was written:

April 2000 back when Netscape
was a thing. 

Anyways, Netscape 6.0 went
into its first public beta.
And it was not any public
beta. It took THREE years for
Netscape to upgrade from 4.0
to 6.0. It was not an
accident.

Netscape committed the worst
sin a software startup could
make while it was in business
for a critical product for
less than TEN YEARS:

Rewrite the NetScape Code from
Scratch. 

NOTE TO SELF: Whenever you
solve a problem by making code
for it, MAKE SURE YOU
NEVER.EVER.EVER.HAVE.To.SOLVE.IT.AGAIN
