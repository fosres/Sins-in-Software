The best founders were the ones that were
self-reliant and could thus be relied upon easily.

You did not have to babysit them for discipline.

Especially when it came to handling money.

Immaturatity often breeds in the form of denial of
one's faults.

Let me show you how that forms in egoistic
startup founders as told by a YC partner:

My feeling with the bad groups is that coming into
office hours, they have alrady decided what they are
going to do and everything I say is being put through
an internal process in their heads, which either
desperately tries to munge what I have just said into
something that conforms with their decision or just
just outright dismiss it and creates a rationalization
for doing so. They may not even be conscious of the
process but that's what I think is happening when you
say something to bad groups and they have that glazed
over look. I don't think it's confusion or lack of
understanding per se, it's the internal process at 
work.

But PG asserts that for the good groups:

With the good groups, you can tell that everything you
say is being looked at with fresh eyes and even if
it's dismissed, it's because of some logical reason
e.g. "we already tried that" or "from speaking to our
users that is not what they would like,", etc.
Those groups never have that glazed over look.
