Lesson on Hiring People

What kind of person would you want to hire

for the coding job?

As for me, I would like the person who not

only could conquer ALL THE PROBLEMS in

"The Elements of Programming Interviews in

C++" by Adnan Aziz. We would also want them

to be able to pass tests in working on fictional 

projects as a team. Basically, we will organize coders

so that they work in groups of two. They must

be of equivalent skill level or one of the worse

coders will weigh down the potential of the other

better coder. But what are the many,

many tests this does?

1. The coder does a great job of

archiving code AND DOCUMENTING CODE

THEY MADE IN THE PAST. The fictional

project will be designed to test this

in mind. Basically, the project will

offer coding problems similiar (but slightly

harder as they are allowed computers this

time) to the coding interview questions--

except these coding projects are actually

based on past coding projects the software

company has actually solved. Anyways,

the best coders will thus obviously be the

ones who have archived AND DOCUMENTED THEIR

CODE OUTSTANDINGLY because they will be able

to look at the similiar code they made in the

past and simply copy and paste the code

wherever necesssary.

Now, if only we could figure out how to distinguish

the best project managers and software architects?:
