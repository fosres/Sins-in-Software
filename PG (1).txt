Why investors are interested in startups.
Although horribly risky, the returns are
AWESOME.

AND

because the return on their investments are

EASY TO OVERSEE. The founders cannot enrich
themselves without also enriching the investors.

The growth of the startup is why VCs want to invest
in startups: the returns are high

AND

generating returns from capital gains is easier
to manage than generating returns from dividends

But what is in it for the founders to receive help
from VCs. The VC money helps startups choose and
calibrate their growth rate.

Investors get their capital back, ideally afte the 
startup IPOs, or failing that when it is acquired.

THe essay Startup = Growth contains plenty of
financial advice. But you have to understand 
Stock Market Investing to be able to read it.

"If you have an idea of growth and don't grow
fast enough, competitors will." -- PG

The reason big companies give "acquisition offers" 
(offers to buy the startup) is to protect the big 
company from competition (startup could grow so big
it kills big company when it itself becomes big 
company) and to take advantage of the rapid growth
of the startup. This will be the biggest thing that
gets in your way when making a startup turn into a 
big company--being tempted to sell the startup to an
already existing big company. That is why Google 
bought Youtube. That is why Mark Zuckerberg bought 
Instagram. 

In a sense, a startup founder is an economic research
scientist. They are not commited to solving any 
specific problem. They are not sure which problems
are soluble. Yet they are commiting to try to
discover something no one knew before.
